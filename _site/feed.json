Creating interactivescripts was funny because I could create start scripts for my games and favorite applications.In only a few weeks I became obsessed with the idea of create a videogame so I moved toPascal and Borland Delphi. A friend of mine discovered a package or IDE for game programming,the software in question was Div Games Studio 2. There was the real beginning, all of my friendsstarted creating games with Div2 it was a great summer (we were kids on vacation) and all ofus created really cool demos, but one of us really stood out about the rest, he developed his ownparticle system for creating really cool explossions almost with no lag, him called the demo supernova.I learned so much from this friend, it was 3 years older than me and he did a great job on explaining methings about resources consuming and basic topics about optimization and maths.With the passing of time we discovered Div2 was very resource consuming for the kind of demos we werecreating and we started to diverge. I choose the path of C++ when my older friend started with .net and C#.At this time I already was a big FreeBSD fanboy and GNU/Linux user. So I decided to learn all I couldabout systems administration and maintenance. I fall in love with servers to be honest, I tried every kindof home made server at my home.
