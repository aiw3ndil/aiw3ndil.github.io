Welcome to my personal blog. I'm a [Web Developer](/portfolio) based on Madrid.

I will be sharing some of my thoughts on topics related to programming, FreeBSD and maybe books, video games and music. 

I hope you will enjoy the content or maybe find it useful.

One of the reasons to write this blog is to improve my English, so I'm sorry if you find some grammatical errors.
